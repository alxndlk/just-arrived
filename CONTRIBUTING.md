## 🛠 How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue

If you’ve found a bug, a missing city detail, or have a suggestion — start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/alxndlk/just-arrived/issues). This helps us track and discuss it.

### 2. Create a Pull Request

If you'd like to propose a fix or add new data:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

### 3. Code Style

- Use `black` for formatting Python code
- JSON files must be UTF-8 encoded and properly indented
- All changes should pass validation against the `CityData` schema

---

## 🔒 Rules

- **PRs require approval** — no one can push directly to `main`
- Pull Requests should only modify relevant city files or scripts
- Do not modify generated files unless updating a specific data point
